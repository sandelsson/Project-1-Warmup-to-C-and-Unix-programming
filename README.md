# Project-1-Warmup-to-C-and-Unix-programming

1/3 of the project assignments for the course: CT30A3370 Käyttöjärjestelmät ja systeemiohjelmointi

5 different use cases:

1. No arguments given: User types in input and the output will be reversed in stdout.
2. Too many arguments --> exit(1)
3. Input and output files are provided but they're identical --> exit(1)
4. Input is given, output not --> input is read from file and printed reversely on stdout.
5. Input and output supplied --> input is read from file and then written reversely on the output file.

Reverse-function should run with these parameters as instructed:

prompt> ./reverse

prompt> ./reverse input.txt

prompt> ./reverse input.txt output.txt

Theres pikkukalle.txt file ready for testing purposes. Further information of how to program works you can check from reverse.c file comments.
